My first foray into the Advent of Code challenge. For this project, I'm using Golang which I'd love to come to grips with more.

To run against a particular day, ensure Golang (1.19.3) is installed and run (at the root)

`go run main.go {day}`

Example:

`go run main.go 1`

To run for all days, don't specify the day argument.
